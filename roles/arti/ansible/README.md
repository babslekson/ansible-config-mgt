# Ansible
This collection provides roles for installing Artifactory and Xray. Additionally, it provides optional SSL and Postgresql roles if these are needed for your deployment.

## Roles Provided
### artifactory
The artifactory role installs the Artifactory Pro software onto the host. Per the Vars below, it will configure a node as primary or secondary. This role uses secondary roles artifactory_nginx to install nginx.

### artifactory_nginx_ssl
The artifactory_nginx_ssl role installs and configures nginx for SSL.

### postgres
The postgres role will install Postgresql software and configure a database and user to support an Artifactory or Xray server.

### xray
The xray role will install Xray software onto the host. An Artifactory server and Postgress database is required.

## Vars Required
The following Vars must be configured.

## Example Inventory and Playbooks
Example playbooks are located in the [examples](../examples) directory. This directory contains several example inventory and playbooks for different Artifactory, HA and Xray architectures.

## Executing a Playbook
```
ansible-playbook -i <hosts file> <playbook file>
```

## Autogenerating Master and Join Keys
You may want to auto-generate your master amd join keys and apply it to all the nodes.

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml playbook.yml --extra-vars "master_key=$(openssl rand -hex 16) join_key=$(openssl rand -hex 16)"
```

## Using [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) to Encrypt Vars
Some vars you may want to keep secret. You may put these vars into a separate file and encrypt them using [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html).

```
ansible-vault encrypt secret-vars.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt
```

then in your playbook include the secret vars file.

```
- hosts: primary

  vars_files:
    - ./vars/secret-vars.yml
    - ./vars/vars.yml

  roles:
    - artifactory
```

## Bastion Hosts
In many cases, you may want to run this Ansible collection through a Bastion host to provision JFrog servers. You can include the following Var for a host or group of hosts:

```
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -A user@host -W %h:%p"'

eg.
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -A ubuntu@{{ azureDeployment.deployment.outputs.lbIp.value }} -W %h:%p"'
```
